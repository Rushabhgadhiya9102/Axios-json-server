## 🧠 State Management

React hooks used:
- `useState` for state variables like products, warehouse selections, etc.
- `useEffect` for data fetching and live chart updates
- `useRef` for form input references
- `useNavigate` for routing

## 📋 Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
````

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the local JSON server:

   ```bash
   npx json-server --watch db.json --port 3000
   ```

4. Start the React development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## ⚠️ Notes

* File uploads are limited to 5MB and read as Base64 strings.
* Be sure to have `json-server` installed globally or use `npx`.
